# Project: Landing Page

Try to mimic a webpage with an image that was provided.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, and Chrome DEVTOOLS. 

## Features

- I added :hover as personally I think it makes for a cleaner peruse. I also kept img boxes incase I want to update with some photos in the near future.
